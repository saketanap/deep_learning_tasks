Write a CUDA program for computing the dot product of a vector in parallel with 
each row of a matrix. You are required to have each thread access consecutive
memory locations (coalescent memory access). The inputs are 

1. number of rows
2. number of columns
3. a data matrix file similar to the format in the Chi2 program 
4. a vector file (one row)
5. cuda device
6. number of threads

For example if the input is

1 2 0
1 1 0
1 2 1

and w = (2, 4, 6)

then your program should output

10
6
16

Compute the dot products in parallel your kernel function. You will have to
transpose the data matrix in order to get coalescent memory access. 

Submit your assignments by copying your program to your AFS course folder
/afs/cad/courses/ccs/s19/cs/677/002/<UCID>. Copy your source files, Makefile,
and the sgescript file with the cp command. For example:

cp solution.cu solution.h kernel.cu Makefile sgescript 
/afs/cad/courses/ccs/s19/cs/677/002/<UCID>

The assignment is due on midnight Feb 11th, 2019.
