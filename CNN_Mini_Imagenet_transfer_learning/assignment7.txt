Write a convolutional network in Keras to train the Mini-ImageNet 
dataset on the course website. You may use transfer learning. Your
goal is to achieve above 80% accuracy on the test/validation datasets.

Submit your assignments as two files train.py and test.py. Make
train.py take two inputs: the input training directory
and a model file name to save the model to.

python train.py train <model file>

Make test.py take two inputs: the test directory
and a model file name to load the model.

python test.py test <model file>

The output of test.py is the test error of the data which is
the number of misclassifications divided by size of the test set.

Copy both your programs and model file to your AFS 
course folder /afs/cad/courses/ccs/s19/cs/677/002/<UCID>. The 
assignment is due on April 24th 2019.
